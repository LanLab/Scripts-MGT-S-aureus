# Scripts-MGT-S-aureus
The following additional custom scripts were used for the development of MGT for *Staphylococcus aureus*.

**Script 1**: Subsets the dataset, such that each ST is sampled proportionally based on that ST's frequency in the species dataset 

**Script 2**: Calculate number of recomination events per locus, and count the number of recombinant regions that overlap. 

**Script 3**: Separates the core loci into preferences, and select core loci to fill the different MGT levels (from MGT2 to MGT7).
